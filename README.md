## What is teletraffic-engineering?

This is a project site from the University of Victoria's Spring 2025 offering of CSC 579. My project currently explores which ideas from Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have yet to be applied to Teletraffic Engineering (TE). 

## How to use

Currently, the easiest way to view the site is at its URL on the web, (<https://anormananderson.github.io/teletraffic-engineering>). There are detailed installation instructions provided in my final report and the blog post about the project code.
